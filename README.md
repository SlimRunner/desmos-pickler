# Desmos Pickler / Image Serializer

This is a fun project I made heavily inspired by @wompking, who came up with the idea of serializing Desmos graphs into a PNG image for the purpose of archival in a creative and cool way. The term pickling is being borrowed from Python.

# Installation

1. Install [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension
1. Install this user script [Desmos Pickler][picklerraw]

Two buttons to will appear on Desmos on the top-right corner right next to settings. The first button from left to right is "Load Pickle" (load a graph), and the second button is "Save Pickle" (download a graph).
